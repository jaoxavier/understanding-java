# Java Basic Syntax

- After creste our first code in the last Section, we need to undestand what our code means

```java
    public class Main{
        public static void main(String[] args){
            System.out.println("Hello World")
        }
    }
```

- Every line of code runs in Java must be inside a `class`, in the Example, we used the class Main.
    + Note: Java is case sensitive, this mean that 'MyClass' and 'myclass' has different meaning
    + Note 2: The name of file must be the same in the class name, in our example, the file was called Main.java and the class Main

### main()

- Required in every Java program, any code inside this method will be executed
