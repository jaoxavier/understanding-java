# System.out.println()

- We use this method to output a text in the terminal, inside the main() method, you can add `println()` as you want.
    + Note: You can use `println()` or `print()`, but the ln will add a new line for each method

```java
    System.out.println("Hello")
    System.out.println("World")
    // Hello
    // World
    System.out.print("Hello")
    System.out.print("World")
    // HelloWorld
```
- It is important to note that words need to be marked by double quotes, using that java knows we are outputting a string

### Print Numbers

- We can also use the `print()` or `println()` to print numbers or perform mathematical calculations, but we don't need to use the double quotes

```java
    System.out.println(80085)
    System.out.println(2 + 2)
    System.out.println(2 * 3)
    // 80085
    // 4
    // 6
```
