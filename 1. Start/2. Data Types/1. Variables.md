# Variables

- Java is a programming language that is statically typed, which means all variables need to be declared before initialization. 
- In Java, there are different types of variables for storing data values:

    + String - Stores text - Surrounded by double quotes
        + ex. "Hello", "World"

    + int - Stores integers (whole numbes) - without decimals
        + ex. 123, 654

    + float - Stores floating point numbers, with decimals
        + ex. 19.9, - 9.99

    + char - Stores single characters - Surrounded by single quotes
        + ex. 'A', '4'

    + boolean - Stores ``true`` or ``false``

## Decleare or Create Variables

- To declare a variable, we need to specify the type, name and assign it a value

> type variableName = value;

- For example:

```java
    String myLove = "Kely";
    int age = 21;
```

- We can assign the value after declare the variable

```java
    String myLove;
    myLove = "Kely";
```

- We can modify the value

```java
    int age = 21;
    age = 22; // age is now 22
```

## Final

- We saw in the last section that we can modify the value of a variable, but ``final`` variables don't make this possible

```java
    String final myLove = "Kely";
    myLove = "Bianca" // Generates error
```

## Demostration how declare

```java
    String myLove = "Kely"
    int age = 21;
    char initial_of_her_man = 'J';
    boolean she_loves_me = true;
    float floatNum = 5.99f
```
