# Print Variables

- As we saw before, we can print numbers and text, as we can print variables, to combine text with variable, use the `+` character

```java
    String name = "Jo達o";
    System.out.println("Hello " + name);
    // Hello Jo達o
```

- We can also use `+` to add a variable to another one:

```java
    String first_name = "Jo達o";
    String last_name = " Xavier";
    String full_name = first_name + last_name;
    System.out.println(full_name)
    // Jo達o Xavier
```
